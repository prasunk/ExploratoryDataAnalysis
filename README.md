## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ?
EDA is a phenomenon under data analysis used for gaining a better understanding of data aspects like:
- main features of data
- variables and relationships that hold between them
- identifying which variables are important for our problem

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

## various exploratory data analysis methods
- *Descriptive Statistics*, which is a way of giving a brief overview of the dataset we are dealing with, including some measures and features of the sample
- *Grouping data* [Basic grouping with group by]
- ANOVA, Analysis Of Variance, which is a computational method to divide variations in an observations set into different components.
- *Correlation and correlation methods*
